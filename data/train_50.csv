chronic obstructive pulmonary disease she was also prescribed levofloxacin for a presumed pneumonia while on the floor the patient was also treated for congestive heart failure exacerbation with mg of lasix intravenously twice per day she was noted to be tachycardic up to the 160s but then bottomed out in response to lopressor the patient was felt to have a tachy brady syndrome electrophysiology was consulted at this time a repeat echocardiogram was also performed and this showed an ejection fraction of less than with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and severe global left ventricular hypokinesis this was a marked decrease in function from the echocardiogram in because of the tachy brady syndrome the patient received a ddi pacemaker during the pacemaker placement the patient developed atrial flutter and was shocked with joules which resulted in a normal sinus rhythm she then became disoriented she was started on coumadin digoxin and quinidine she then developed episodes of desaturations to while off hospital1 level positive airway pressure at this point she was transferred to the medical intensive care unit in the medical intensive care unit the patient was hypoxic without clear reason she was intubated for continued hypoxia overall the patient was thought to be hypoxic either from ongoing congestive heart failure or atelectasis the patient was also aggressively diuresed with lasix and then natrecor she did develop acute renal failure with a bump in her creatinine to the patient s hypoxia was further worked up with a chest computed tomography which showed excessive collapse of the bronchus intermedius consistent with bronchomalacia in addition to left lower lobe with bronchus collapse she was also noted to have multifocal patchy consolidation and ground glass in both upper lobes a flexible bronchoscopy revealed marked collapse the differential diagnosis at that point included neoplasm infection and chronic fibrosis which would have been consistent with her previously restrictive pulmonary function tests patterns the rest of the medical intensive care unit course was most significant for an inability to wean the patient off the ventilator the patient failed a pressure support trial a family meeting was held and the family was informed that the patient would not tolerate weaning and that further options

relatively well controlled with units of lantus daily and a humalog sliding scale this was decreased to units of lantus as his blood sugars were much lower once the high dose steroids were stopped it is recommended that if his blood sugars increased wait at least hours before further increasing his lantus dose to avoid precipitating hypoglycemia he was continued on his home dose of levoxyl it is recommended that he follow up at the hospital clinic after his stay at rehab on the day prior to discharge he became acutely hypoxic down to oxygen saturation of on ra cxr and physical exam most

diagnosed in who was transferred from the hospital6 for potential liver transplantation she was admitted at hospital6 from to intravenous heroin until when she voluntarily entered detoxification program and was started on methadone on the patient began to experience sweats fevers chills nausea vomiting and was noted to be mildly jaundiced she was sent to the hospital6 emergency department from detoxification afebrile and with a blood pressure of and respiratory rate of 50s her lfts were markedly a right upper quadrant ultrasound was done which showed a normal liver normal bile ducts and no ascites she was initially treated with vitamin k methadone and phenergan and on was begun on lamivudine for hepatitis b treatment after her hepatitis panel came back positive for a hepatitis b surface antigen and negative hepatitis b surface antibody she was also found to have a positive hepatitis c antibody the patient s inr rose to and she was transfused with two units of fresh frozen plasma during the course of her admission the patient s liver work up at hospital6 included first name8 namepattern2 doctor first name anti smooth muscle antibody iron studies and ceruloplasmin all of which were negative the patient was also found to be hepatitis a antibody negative on the patient was discharged from hospital6 to home with gastrointestinal follow up her inr at discharge was the following day the patient presented to the hospital hospital emergency department her lfts on admission were as follows alt ast alkaline phosphatase t bilirubin direct bilirubin her ammonia was and her inr was the patient had a head ct and toxicology screen both of which were negative she was treated with vitamin k and lactulose she also got narcan without effect she was transferred back to hospital6 on with the following vital signs she was afebrile with a pulse of respiratory rate of blood pressure at hospital6 she was treated with lactulose vitamin k lamivudine and her mental status was noted to be significantly depressed compared to her discharge the day prior and she was reported to have been intermittently responsive with nonsensible speech and unable to follow verbal commands she was treated with increasing doses of lactulose without significant improvement in her mental status that in essence was the hospital medical course prior to her arrival at the hospital6 on when she arrived here her physical examination was as follows her vitals were as follows temperature pulse respiratory rate blood pressure saturating on room air in general she appeared to be an ill appearing woman who appeared her stated age she was in no apparent distress and had marked jaundice her head eyes ears nose and throat exam was significant for the following her sclera were icteric bilaterally her pupils equal round and reactive to light her oropharynx was clear her mucous membranes were moist she had no cervical adenopathy she had no jugular venous distention and she had no thyromegaly her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally her heart was regular rate and rhythm with a systolic ejection murmur her abdomen was soft with mild right upper quadrant tenderness she was nondistended with good bowel sounds and no hepatosplenomegaly her extremities revealed edema in her hands there was no clubbing or cyanosis she had pedal pulses neurologically she was alert and oriented times two she did have difficulty with attention but was able to follow most verbal commands her muscle strength was throughout her sensation was grossly intact her deep tendon reflexes were cerebellar function was depressed the patient was not able to do finger to nose and she did have asterixes her skin exam was significant for marked jaundice but there were no rashes and no spider angiomata that was appreciated laboratories on admission significant for a inr of her ptt was and her pt was her chem was notable for a potassium of her cbc was within normal limits her calcium magnesium and phosphorus were all within normal limits her liver function tests were as follows alt ast alkaline phosphatase ldh albumin total bilirubin direct bilirubin and ammonia hospital course the liver service was consulted on the night of her admission regarding possible transplantation we initially treated her for a grade hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose regarding her risk for cerebral edema and increase in intracranial pressure the decision was made to perform neurologic checks every two hours and to address the issue of icp monitoring if she did develop signs of intracranial pressure and if the decision was made to place the monitor we would then further consider possible mannitol and intubation with hyperventilation for her liver failure the patient did not meet the first name4 namepattern1 last name namepattern1 criteria for liver transplantation however we did initially send off transplant laboratories with the possibility of her qualifying for a transplantation we also continued her on the lamivudine for her coagulopathy we attributed that to her liver failure she was continued on vitamin k and the decision was made to transfuse her with fresh frozen plasma if she developed any evidence of active bleeding or if the decision was made to transfuse her prior to procedures essentially the hospital hospital course was significant for a waxing and doctor last name mental status consistent with her hepatic encephalopathy her encephalopathy on a day to day basis varied from grade to grade during the second week of her admission the patient had two days of significant lucidity at which time she was alert and oriented times three and was able to show some incite into the nature of her current medical status however the following day she was noted to have significantly depressed mental status and was unable to follow verbal commands we continued to treat her aggressively from a medical standpoint once it was determined that she would not qualify for a liver transplantation based on her drug use history per liver service our medical management included lactulose enemas and oral preparations through her nasogastric tube we also treated her with neomycin she continued on her lamivudine throughout the course of her hospitalization additionally from a gastrointestinal standpoint given the fact that her course was somewhat different from typical patient s with acute hepatitis b leading to fulminate hepatic failure we re sent a ceruloplasmin to verify that this patient had no other underlying comorbidities that could be contributing to her liver failure the patient s ceruloplasmin did come back as lower than normal limits at that point the decision was made to consult ophthalmology for the possibility of kayser fleischer rings and to check a serum and urine copper the patient s serum copper came back within normal limits and ophthalmology did find kayser fleischer by direct ophthalmoscope on her exam and at the time of this dictation the urine copper was still pending given the finding on physical exam on the patient was started on penicillamine and pyridoxine for possible wilson s disease the hematology service was consulted on to address the issue of elevated prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time in this patient there was concern about her worsening coagulopathy as she had some improvement in her mental status yet did not seem to show any rebound in her synthetic function in her liver the hematology consults felt that the patient s thrombocytopenia might be secondary to low thrombopoietin production given her liver dysfunction and also felt that there might be some underlying low grade dic also involved however they agreed with our decision to not transfuse the patient with any blood products in the absence of active bleeding despite aggressive medical management with lactulose neomycin lamivudine total parental nutrition the patient s condition continued to deteriorate her mental status never returned to its baseline and her synthetic function of her liver as measured by her inr never reversed on the decision was made during rounds that the patient had essentially exhausted medical management and further treatment would be medically futile this information was passed onto the patient s mother who acknowledged the patient s poor prognosis and agreed to reconsider the patient s code status and agreed with the team that the patient should be made do not intubate do not intubate the mother additionally felt that the patient had suffered a considerable amount and

swallow to assess for the tef but the patient was unable to complete the study as she aspirated the barium during the study however contrast was seen within the left main stem bronchus and distal airways most likely reflecting aspiration although without lateral views persistent tracheoesophageal fistula could not be excluded on she had a follow up cxr that revealed the stent central venous

cardiomegaly unchanged mediastinal widening and increase in mediastinal diameter no newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities ventilator associated pneumonia the bal on revealed mrsa 100k and so the patient was started on iv vancomycin for a total therapy duration of two weeks she remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable throughout her stay pleural effusion on the patient underwent thoracentesis given radiologic and clinic findings that was transudative in nature with glucose ldh and total protein of she was also started on lasix for diuresis hypertension the patient s hypertension was eventually controlled through a combination of clonidine patch enalapril labetolol and metoprolol atrial fibrillation the patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was initially placed on iv diltiazem and esmolol for rate control which was then converted to po meds via the peg however her rate was not controlled until she was digoxin loaded on and her rate slowed from af in the 120s to the 80s she was then placed on her home dose of digoxin mg day which controlled her rate throughout her stay atrial thrombus the ct on revealed a filling defect along posterosuperior wall of left atrium could represent direct extension of tumor or intraluminal thrombus given this finding in the presence of atrial fibrillation she underwent an echocardiogram that revealed a possible 1cm mass in the body of la mild moderate mitral regurgitation mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy but normal cavity size and global systolic function lvef she was then placed on therapeutic lovenox for the fibrillation and the thrombus and given her history of a tia even though she is at a risk for falls dysphagia the patient had a peg tube placed by ir on given that she was intubated for feeding she was started on tube feeds which she tolerated and she was kept npo given that she aspirated during her barium

earlier that day with chills he denied gi gu symptoms cough and chest pain he was given albuterol and atrovent nebs in the ambulance without improvment in the ed he was found febrile to and tachycardiac his rr was in the s with o2 sats in the low s he was intubated for acute respiratory distress his wbc count was with neutrophils and bands a cxr revealed a lll opacity he received levofloxacin and iv steroids for copd exacerbation enzymes revealed a troponin leak though ecg in the ed showed only tachycardia and rbbb he was then admitted to the micu vancomycin was added for mrsa coverage given history of hospitalizations at va with mrsa he was weaned and extubated on and transferred to the floor once extubated levofloxacin and vancomycin were continued he was on scheduled albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments every hours and he continued to use his home advair inhaler he was switched from iv steroids to 60mg of prednisone on he continued to have tachycardia subsequent ecg s revealed inferior lateral st changes two sets of enzymes were negative and his ecg changes were attributed to demand phenomenon in the setting of hypoxia and tachycardia the patient had no chest pain other clinical symptoms or signs of ischemia repeat chest xray revealed lll opacity pleural effusions and signs of pulmonary edema and left heart failure he was diuresed with mg of

transfer to the floor lll pna this continued to show radiographic and symptomatic improvement on levofloxacin day course his wbc trended down and he remained afebrile vancomycin was stopped after four days as it use was not supported by cultures this was felt to be the main exacerbant of his copd flair sob copd this was treated by addressing both the likely exacerbant his pneumonia as well as the underlying pulmonary disease this latter approach included scheduled albuterol and ipratropium nebs hope to eventually transitioned to mdi s a twice daily fluticasone salmeterol inhaler and a prednisone taper mr known lastname unfortunately responded relatively slowly to this treatment following a gradual waxing and doctor last name course of both symptoms and oxygen saturations given his slow improvement and low oxygen sats there was some concern for a pe and a cta was obtained in addition patient received fluids in the micu and chest x ray at that time was consistent with heart failure however patient diuresed well on his own with improvement however since then he remained quite sob and was low 90s on five liters nc a cta was done no evidence of pe please see the results section patient now being transfered to hospital hospital and we recommend a pulmonary consult patient transfered prior to consult being obtained if pulmonary is able to see the patient prior to dc we

and on two separate values when first admitted that subsequently trended down to with normal ck s where they remained this was felt to be secondary to his copd flair the resultant hypoxia and

areas of decreased diffusion corresponding to the leptomeningeal disease with additional foci involving the right thalamus and right hippocampus which may represent acute infarcts although they may be related to lymphomatous involvement versus infectious process given the findings above hypoxic injury would be a less likely differential consideration suboptimal mra and mrv given patient motion there is no definite evidence of venous thrombosis although the sigmoid sinuses and the visualized internal jugular veins are suboptimally evaluated no evidence of a hemodynamically significant

hospital6 following episode of altered mental status early on day of admission that led to intubation for airway protection lymphoma he initially presented to hospital6 with nausea and vomiting on admission here an lp was done that showed a high opening pressure and multiple atypical cells concerning for recurrent cns lymphoma he was started on high dose decadron and was followed by medical oncology neuro oncology and radiation oncology his presenting symptoms were considered a consequence of his worsening lymphoma given his previous treatments with intrathecal chemotherapy he was not considered a candidate for chemotherapy he began palliative full brain xrt on his clinical condition deteriorated and his respiratory status worsened and he was only able to have one treatment on a discussion with the health care proxy led to mr known lastname being made comfort measures only he died on at 40pm altered mental status his ams was most likely caused by recurrent cns lymphoma and increased intracranial pressure he was initially treated with acyclovir for hsv however this was stopped due to low clinical suspicion his mental status did not improve off sedation his mental status deteriorated to the point where he was not responsive likely related to his cns lymphoma and increased icp endotracheal intubation extubation he was intubated for airway protection at an osh prior to admission he self extubated two days after admission without complication he remained off ventilatory support and became hypoxic three days prior to death but was made comfort measures only pneumonia

meningioma and related surgery dmii hypothyroidism once treated for central di with ddavp which then led to hyponatremia and the drug was subsequently d c ed this probably also led to the impression that she has siadh which has never been worked up and diagnosed she presented with days of increased somnelence and poor po intake her na was found to be two days prior to admission and because of her diagnosis of siadh she was further fluid restricted to 500cc fluids per day of note she had three recent admissions in month only for ms changes in month only with mental status changes and ecoli uti in month only with mental status changes and found to have hyponatremia responsive to steriod and ivf as well as enterococci uti her hospital course by system is as follows hyponatremia at presentation her na was she was corrected slowly within hours her na was at which time she had one seizure episode with grimacing and clenching her hands this quickly resolved with iv ativan and decadron she subsequently developed hypotension with sbp to the s and became unresponsive she received fluid rescucitation of 3l ns and transferred to icu for further monitoring in icu her na corrected slowly by ns infusion at a rate calculated for optimal correction na returned to at hours after presentation she received a total of l of ns while in icu she was transferred to medicine floor on hd her serum sodium was maintained within normal limit while patient was npo for poor ms she was also started on iv hydrocortisone mg hospital1 which was later switched to po prednisone 10mg for possible adrenal insufficiency her antihypertensive med lisinopril was discontinued becuase it was thought of as possibly causing siadh her sodium only dropped on one occassion to on hd while pt on ns with improved mental status she was started on a high protein high salt diet with the thought that her severe hyponatremia was likely at least partially due to severe dehydration and poor po intake of electrolytes her na has remained in the normal range two days off ivf at discharge in terms of work up of the causes of her hyponatremia it is really unclear whether she has siadh or not she certainly has all the reasons to have it brain tumor xrt surgery meds however because she presented with such severe hyponatremai and ms changes ns infusion was started before serum osm urine osm were obtained we did obtain on a set of serum osm urine osm however the urine and blood specimens were obtained hours apart and by the time the urine sample was collected the serum na was already normalized because of her recent admissions both with hyponatremia it is unlikely dehydration poor po is the only cause this is probably a multifactorial process with siadh dehydration nutrition deficit and possiblly adrenal insufficiency all contributing to the extremely low na it is thought by the team that patient will need endocrine and renal workup as an outpatient once acute issues are solved appropriate followup are arranged as such she is to be discharged to nursing home with weekly na checks altered mental status at presentation it was likely secondary to hyponatremia but she got head ct which ruled out acute cns process then when her ms worsened with na correction ativan sedation acute response to high dose steroid or central pontine myelinosis were suspected as the cause however cpm is a pathological process without effective treatment her mental status slowly improved with correction of na increased po intake and ivf at discharge she returned to her baseline mentation h o sz in addition to the seizure occured in ed she had two more seizure episodes witnessed by family on both of which resolved spontaneously within seconds she was restarted on keppra which was discontinued weeks ago because of sedative effect then her antiseizure meds were adjusted by neuro at discharge she was taking only 100mg qhs this dose is to continue until 2wk course0 then she is

particularly the right posterior quadrant in addition there were frequent runs of up to seconds of hz sharp and slow wave discharges seen in the right posterior quadrant consistent with electrographic

was seen suggestive of a moderate encephalopathy which may be seen with medication effect toxic metabolic abnormalities or infections in addition there was infrequent left mid temporal mixed frequency slowing suggestive of subcortical dysfunction in this region eeg impression this is an abnormal hour video eeg telemetry in the waking and sleeping states due to the single electrographic seizure noted over the central electrodes on prior recordings this was associated with left temporal electrographic seizure however at the time of the recording the left temporal electrodes did not appear to be functioning as well in addition there were bilateral independent left mid temporal and right posterior quadrant sharp and slow wave discharges at best at a frequency of once every two seconds this

the emergency department after holding her home dose of beta blocker for less than twenty four hours she was transferred to the floor gram positive bacteremia mrs known lastname was found to have gram positive bacteremia identified as corynebacterium stratium portal of entry was likely skin soft tissue due to prolonged qtc and bradycardia on admission and transfer to the floor she was evaluated for diphtherial infection with toxin induced myocarditis and placed on droplet precautions patient had not received an updated tdap immunization as an outpatient and she is somewhat immunocompromised due to her age and her chronically uncontrolled diabetes mellitus but she was thought to have very unlikely exposure to diphtheria patient states that she has had no pharyngeal symptoms in the past month per family she has had a cough which is only associated with difficulty swallowing diphtherial toxoid tests were drawn from the serum and a nasopharyngeal swab was taken for culture and sent to the hospital3 for diagnosis a transthoracic echo was done which showed no signs of valvular vegetations or endocarditis patient was initiated on intravenous penicillin therapy for the bacteremia which would empirically cover diphtherial infection as well as other species of corynebacterium when culture results showed only intermediate sensitivity to penicillin patient was started on intravenous vancomycin therapy which is to be continued at a therapeutic level for two weeks counting day as this was presently being dosed ever hours given her clearance less than 30cc min patient was followed by infectious disease team who stated that there was no indication for diphtheria anti toxin due to the low possibility of a diphtheria diagnosis and the dangerous potential for serum sickness if given the id team recommended also that she get repeat blood cultures after finishing course of antibiotics to ensure they are negative otherwise transesophageal echo and treatment for endocarditis could be considered but would involve additional risk droplet precautions for possible diphtheria were removed prior to discharge because of the extremely low likelihood of the patient having the specific illness gastrointestinal bleed likely gastritis the patient developed semi formed melenotic stools during admission she was briefly anticoagulated during part of her stay but this occured following cessation she required units of blood last occuring on and has maintained her hematocrit in the mid 30s she was advanced to fulls and restarted on sc heparin her plavix was discontinued during this episode and her aspirin was reduced to 81mg from 325mg po daily altered mental status per patient s family patient had clouded mental status the day prior to admission but returned to baseline the day following admission celexa ferrous sulfate were held due to possible contribution to mental status patient likely was delirious secondary to bacteremic infection which improved with start of antibiotics she was alert and oriented to hospital hospital and roughly the accurate date she is followed by first name4 namepattern1 last name namepattern1 of behavioral neurology at hospital1 at time of discharge she was oriented and near baseline sharp functional decline per family and home health aide patient s executive function and activities of daily living have been declining over the past four to eight weeks in addition to increased generalized weakness home health aide states she takes two hours to eat her meals and has increased difficulty paying her bills after an inpatient gerontology consult it was shown that patient has some level of dementia and could benefit from increased structure in her schedule in addition to an outpatient geriatrics consult she was also evaluated by physical therapy during the course of her hospital stay per speech and swallow study patient was shown to have difficulty swallowing thin liquids with increased risk of aspiration she was placed on a dysphagia diet with nectar thickened liquids bradycardia tachycardia patient was admitted with bradycardia which had since resolved with discontinuing her beta blocker she was monitored on telemetry for the duration of her hospital stay the bradycardia could have been secondary to ischemic heart disease and vasovagal reaction but likely is due to sick sinus syndrome after holding beta blockers her heart rate increased and appeared to be in atrial fibrillation but less than hours most likely the arrhythmia has resolved and given her bruising and in the setting of illness she was not treated with anticoagulation for this indication this has been monitored on telemetry and did not recur and likely is related to infection if she has ongoing tachycardia

patient patient continued to have good oxygen saturation at on room air and denied shortness of breath despite transition to tachycardia and a singular episode of chest pain on she was determined unlikely to have had a pulmonary embolism due to stable respiratory status and no further evidence of dvt on lower extremity ultrasound chronic venous stasis and peripheral vascular disease patient was initially treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for cellulitis secondary to chronic venous stasis as source for presenting profound leukocytosis these antibiotics were stopped after source of infection was found to be in bloodstream but vancomycin was restarted based on sensitivities patient is well known to vascular surgery and was followed by their team during inpatient stay chronic left ventricular systolic heart failure on transthoracic echo patient was noted to have an estimated ef of and global left ventricular dysfunction her diuretics were held in the setting of acute renal failure and due to overall picture of decreased intravascular volume status acute on chronic renal failure patient presented with acute renal failure on top of chronic renal insufficiency her creatinine was on admission but had returned to her baseline of by the time of discharge so her acute renal failure had resolved patient was not given extra intravenous fluids aside from the preparations of intravenous antibiotics due to her history of chronic systolic heart failure her chronic renal insufficiency likely secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension diabetes mellitus throughout her stay on the floor patient s blood sugars were very uncontrolled many times above her basal dose of glargine was increased significantly and she was uptitrated slowly on an insulin lispro sliding scale to better control sugars yet avoid hypoglycemia hypertension patient had relative hypotension with systolic blood pressure most often in the 100s 120s despite her history of hypertension her atenolol was held in the setting of bradycardia on admission and acute on chronic renal failure after resolution of the bradycardia she was started on low dose metoprolol and titrated up slowly she was also started on low dose lisinopril due to her heart failure coronary artery disease due to her history of ischemic heart disease mrs known lastname was ruled out for acute

visit today known firstname was able to mouth yes and no appropriately she demonstrates upbeat nystagmus in all positions today though it is maximal with upgaze this suggests a lesion in the brainstem connections with the anterior semicircular canals this tends to occur in the pontomedullary junction and this localization is consistent with the known enhancing lesion seen on the overnight mri from yesterday because her ocular findings developed over the past couple of days which her parents confirm it argues against the lesion being ischemic and directly related to her original trauma as that event was over two weeks ago and would be beyond the period of maximal swelling i understand the lesion is felt to be an abscess which would be more in line with the development of her symptoms and findings the trauma team is already consulting the infectious disease consultants to confirm appropriateness of her current antimicrobial regimen we have nothing further to offer her at this time particularly as our neurosurgical colleagues are already seeing her and have rendered an opinion re the likelihood of being able to remove or drain this lesion if it continues to expand please let us

you likely can discontine this medication after a short period of time your doctor will need to check the levels of this medication in approximately weeks time and he will tell you if you need to continue the medication after that date signs of a serious side effect of dilatin include unsteady gait and rash if you develop either of these symptoms stop taking dilatin immediately and contact your doctor or go to the emergency room while an inpatient you had a chest x ray which showed multiple nodules in your lungs a ct scan of your torso showed that there are also lesions in your liver

subcutaneous gas consistent with recent mediastinoscopy a small left lower paratracheal collection containing fluid and gas could represent post procedural changes correlation with recent procedure

while in the icu his renal function improved with gentle intravascular hydration echo was performed which revealed severe diastolic dysfunction with ejection fraction of his digoxin was therefore discontinued he was discharged to the floor after hours of observation while on the medical service the patient was brought to the or on for flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage of the left upper lobe cervical mediastinoscopy and bronchoscopy on post op cxr there was noticeable whiteout of the left lung field and the patient was kept in the pacu for observation he was treated with chest pt is and suctioning for the thought of possible mucus plugging as per documentation the patient was doing well until the morning when he had increasing oxygen requirements and more labored breathing at 8am on the patient underwent unremarkable bronchoscopy by ip patient continued to have a significant oxygen requirement satting on facemask thus was transferred to the icu for monitoring in icu on patient underwent upper airway suctioning along with albuterol ipratropium and mucinex treatment he utilized incentive spirometry as well serial chest x rays showed eventual clearing of his left lung his oxygen saturation improved to on 4l he underwent a chest ct which showed a large right pleural effusion and left airspace disease possibly consistent with pneumonia he continued to produce increasing amounts of airway mucous though he did not spike a fever or develop a leukocytosis he was started on empiric coverage for hospital acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn this was continued for a total of days and then discontinued his respiratory status continued to improve and he was weaned down to 2l nc o2 and often maintained o2 sats on room air at rest he was transferred from the icu to the medicine floor on where the below issues were addressed hypoxia thought to be due to mucus plugging in setting of procedure given the acuity of both the change and the reversal it is likely that he experienced lung collapse and then reaeration of expectorating mucus received days of vanc zosyn for presumed hap coverage in setting of hypoxia and increased sputum production this was d c d with no additional fevers and decreasing sputum he was continued on ipratropium nebs mucomyst nebs guaifenesin incentive spirometry during his stay his oxygen requirement was

the bladder is obscured by shadowing from the air within the urinary bladder likely due to air of foley catheter placement impression limited study no hydronephrosis non visualization of the bladder

an year old male with a history of cad chf afib htn ckd who presented with recurrent hypoglycemia acute renal failure and delerium he was initially admitted to the icu hypoglycemia differential diagnosis on admission included reactive hypoglycemia pre diabetes medication effect from levofloxacin and insulinoma pt had been admitted earlier this month for hypoglycemic episodes thought to be due to hyperinsulinemia in the setting of pre diabetes and decreased renal clearance on the last admission his insulin levels and c peptide levels were elevated with low hydroxybutyrate which could be consistent with insulinoma however these test results are difficult to interpret in the setting of having just received glucagon prior per the family the pt had been checking his fingersticks with his wife up to times a day after his last discharge with most values in the 100s the pt was diagnosed with bronchitis or cap the day prior to admission this time and was started on levofloxacin in the icu the patient required iv d5 overnight to keep fsg with q1hour fs checks endocrine was consulted who originally recommended supervised fast to discern between reactive hypoglycemia and insulinoma however the patient had st depressions overnight with slight bump in his troponins so it was decided not to stress the heart by fasting on the day after admission the patient started taking po diabetic consistent carb diet his fsg was maintained overnight and he was called out to the floor after the pt had been off of levofloxacin for hours endocrine wanted to pursue a fasting trial for hours as of pts can be diagnosed with insulinoma with only a hr fast as opposed to hr fast the lowest his fingerstick dropped to was at which point insulin beta hydroxybutyrate and proinsulin levels were drawn pending at discharge he fingerstick quickly came back up to on its own endocrine felt based on this fasting test the pt likely has reactive hypoglycemia and not an insulinoma the patient should not ever take a fluoroquinolone again given risk of hypoglycemia he should continue to follow a diabetic diet eat small and frequent meals to prevent post prandial hyperinsulinemia and check fingersticks fasting in the morning and at various times during the day at home in the morning and before meals at rehab he was provided with a glucagon emergency kit on his last admission he has outpatient endocrine follow up acute renal faiure patient s creatinine increased to in the icu we stopped lasix and spironolactone urine output remained stable urine lytes were c w feurea of he was continued on ivf and creatinine fell to back to baseline at time of discharge his lasix and aldactone can be restarted if he gains more than lbs or has any evidence of volume overload demand ischemia tachycardia patient became tachycardic overnight on admission ck mb mbi trop t started heparin gtt and called cardiology consult cardiology did not feel his presentation was consistent with acs so we stopped heparin and started aspirin ce trended down then community acquired pneumonia patient reported cough for the past few days with dyspnea on exertion and r sided crackles we had started the patient on levofloxacin but per endocrine there are case reports of levoflox causing hypoglycemia so we changed to cefpodoxime and azithromycin to complete a day course the pt did have noted rll ronchi and later in the hospital stay cxr did show a small rll infiltrate he continues to have a cough and some ronchi which is likely residual from his pna bronchitis was satting ra at discharge anemia ckd hematocrit drop pt had hct drop from to over date range down from baseline of at baseline pt is anemic likey due to ckd and has been receiving epogen as an outpatient hct on admission was

following issues were addressed during her extended hospitalization pulmonary pe she did not have a cta initially due to dye allergy an echo was done which showed no evidence of right heart strain she continued to be hypoxic though and pe was suspected she was put on heparin empirically and d dimer was drawn and very high this could be the result in someone with cancer as well though she was premedicated and had a cta it revealed multiple right sided pes she was continued on the heparin after this finding she was also continued on oxygen and was maintaining good o2 sats she remained tachypneic and tachycardic though due to a recent study in the nejm which showed a benefit of lmwh over coumadin in cancer patients at preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism she was started on lovenox instead of coumadin she continued to be tachypneic and tachycardic for the remainder of the admission she also continued to require oxygen to keep her sats up she was switched back to a heparin drip for several days in order to have invasive procedures undertaken without problem after this she was put back on lovenox and had no issues with her pes she was sent out on lovenox mg kg hospital1 to prevent recurrence of dvt or pe fevers id pneumonia she initially presented after having a lul density on cxr while at xrt this was treated as an outpatient for days with levaquin with no improvement she had fevers chills night sweats for days before admission when she was admitted she was started on unasyn in the hospital unit name she defervesed initially on this and remained so for several days she continued to have a persistent cough though and her o2 requirement did not decrease cxrs continued to show a lul infiltrate and she again began having daily fevers she was changed to zosyn but continued to have daily fevers on this no other source of infection was identified as she had negative blood cultures negative urine cultures and no obvious source of cellulitis skin involvement she did continue to have a persistent productive cough with nothing growing from her sputum pulmonary was consulted and performed a bronchoscopy they found that she had no complete airway obstruction but did have some partial compression of her airways by her tumor this added to the suspicion that she may have a post obstructive pneumonia a bal was performed and grew no bacteria but did grow female first name un albicans she had some known oral last name lf first name3 lf there was a question of whether this was a contaminant id was consulted and she was started on iv fluconazole and azithromycin the zosyn was also continued she continued to spike daily fevers through her antibiotics though repeat cxrs showed a growing pleural effusion on the left ip was called to do an ultrasound guided thoracentesis they were able to get very little fluid despite seeing a large amount on ultrasound it appeared to be possibly loculated it appeared to be a transudate and did not grow anything in culture she did have a complication of a pneumothorax on that side she had pain but kept good o2 sats with this it was treated with nrb oxygen and followed by serial cxrs it resolved on its own by the next day and the oxygen mask was stopped it did not recur she continued to spike fevers despite the above antibiotics again no good source was found she also continued coughing multiple blood cultures and urine cultures continued to be sent with no growth another though physical was performed with no evidence of skin infection abscess oral infection otitis sinusitis or perirectal abscess she was having no dysuria or abdominal pain and a lactate was sent and normal at this point the main hypothesis was post obstructive pneumonia but tumor fever was also a possible cause of these fevers in the face of countless negative cultures as was drug fever she had had the fevers as an outpatient though and none of her drugs were suspicious for causing fevers also the candidal lung infection was considered but her symptoms showed no improvement despite high dose iv fluconazole ip was consulted about stenting her bronchus to help alleviate a possible post obstructive pneumonia but due to her anatomy she was not a candidate for this intervention as she had finished a full course of fluconazole with really no change this medication was stopped she was also switched to po cipro and augmentin which continued to cover her for all possible gram positive and negative pathogens that we were covering with with her iv antibiotics she did not have a change in her clinical picture with this switch the hypothesis on post obstrucive pneumonia was the most likely and as she was not a candidate for a pulmonary stent the plan became to continue radiation therapy and also to restart low dose chemo with the hope of shrinking the tumor and relieving the obstruction this was tried but had not occured after several chemo administrations her oxygen requirement had been improving slowly though and she had gradually worked down to needing l to maintain good oxygenation with this she was eventually sent home with the po ciprofloxacin and augmentin she continued to have daily fevers but no positive cultures her fevers were controlled with tylenol throughout the hospitalization and this worked well she was also on atrovent nebs here fairly regularly which helped to keep her breathing easier and her oxygen requirements down she was sent home with mdis to use albuterol wasn t used often due to her already persistent tachycardia tachycardia she had persistent tachycardia for the entire admission it was attributed to the pes fever anxiety or some combination of these three she had an echo which showed no wall motion abnormalities and her cardiac enzymes checked her troponins were mildly elevated and this was felt to be a leak from the strain she was under from the pes as opposed to an actual mi ecgs showed an old mi but no new ischemic changes a tsh was normal she never had any chest pain her tachycardia continued for the entire hospitalization but more mildly her fevers continued as well so it is difficult to separate the two the tachycardia was monitored but not treated in this setting she was also anemic as below and this may have contributed anemia as an inpatient her hct started gradually drifting downward she had negative stool guaiacs throughout no hematuria no melena no hematemesis or hemoptysis iron studies were sent and showed a combination of anemia of chronic disease and possible iron deficiency anemias she had a normal b12 and folate hemolysis labs were sent and did not indicate hemolysis she was transfused on two separate occasions to keep her hct up she was anticoagulated so bleeding was considered thoroughly she never had a source of bleeding identified the chemo may have been partially responsible for her dropping hct lung cancer she continued to receive xrt for most of her hospitalization she also received several cycles of doctor last name taxol while an inpatient but at low doses due to her acute illness she tolerated all of this very well she had an initial mri at an outpatient center that suggested the presence of a brain met the mri was repeated here on superior equipment and there was no evidence of any metastases to the brain near the end of her stay a planning ct done by rad onc suggested progression of disease rather than regression her chemo was changed as was her radiation portal she will continue with this new protocol as an outpatient a follow up ct will also be done as an outpatient as she wasn t able to get one as an inpatient she will continue with daily outpatient xrt and weekly chemo with dr last name stitle diabetes she was kept on her home glipizide dose and riss to cover for any high blood glucoses she had fairly good control throughout with occassional high numbers on days after she received steroids for chemo premedication otherwise this was stable anxiety she was fairly anxious for much of the hospitalization as there was a lot going on around her and not many definite answers she was given ativan prn for this and it worked well she also used codeine cough syrup at nights which helped her cough and her insomnia external yeast infection she developed a candidal infection in her groin folds this was treated with miconazole powder effectively it had begun to return upon discharge and she was sent home with this treatment to use for herself she had also had oral candidiasis at one point this was treated with nystatin s s along with the iv fluconazole it resolved with these therapies pt she was encouraged to get out of bed frequently both to prevent atelectasis and deconditioning she worked with pt often and regained some of her energy and strength she was eventually able to climb stairs and walk the halls well she also spent most of her days in a chair instead of in bed she did require oxygen while ambulating and at rest though she was discharged home with services for home o2 vna home pt and plans to come for daily xrt and weekly chemo she was continued on her cipro and augmentin as well as lovenox she continued to have daily

dyspnea it was felt that this dyspnea was consistent with a chf exacerbation although based on his lung exam with wheezing and rhonchi it was felt that there was also a copd component to the patient s dyspnea dfa for flu was negative urinary legionella antigen was also negative over the course of his initial icu stay he was treated with iv solumedrol nebs and cepodoxime azithromycin for copd flare he was also diuresed with lasix 120mg iv prn though he autodiuresed aggressively on his own he was transfered to the medical floor on the evening of around midnight of that day he was noted to have increased agitation he was then noted to become hypoxic and tachypneic he was evaluated by the floor team and noted to have diffuse crackles without significant wheezing he was given lasix but remained tachypneic low oxygen sats a cxr revealed bilateral opacification consistent pulmonary edema or new lul infiltrate additionally he was visibly oozing from his left face wound his nose and his lower extremity chronic venous stasis ulcers at this point he was transferred back to the micu upon arrival to the micu he appeared uncomfortable and tachypneic upon placement of bipap he became acutely more uncomfortable sitting forward pursed lip breathing the decision was made to intubate him he was treated as a flash pulmonary edema case he also completed a day course of vanco zosyn for possible hospital acquired pneumonia the patient remained intubated for days during which time he was diuresed with lasix eventually on he was able to be extubated in the days following his extubation he still appeared to be fluid overloaded therefore he continued to be diuresed aggressively over this time he reported that his dyspnea was improving on the patient was transferred from the unit to the medical floor on the floor he was continued to be diuresed and his respiratory status continued to improve by the time of admission his oxygen requirement had decreased to his baseline regimen of 2l nc we increased his home dose of lasix for discharge to the rehabilitation facility and recommended strict daily weights finally based on his anatomy and observing him at sleep in the morning he also may have a component of obstructive sleep apnea which may contribute to his pulmonary problems name ni outpatient workup for osa might be reasonable for this patient chf as stated above when the patient was admitted it was determined that some of his dyspnea was secondary to a chf exacerbation it was felt that he was fluid overloaded he was kept on his home lisinopril on admission and he was diuresed echo done on showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hyopokinesis and moderate mitral regurgitation diuresis continued through most of the patient s icu stay however after his readmission to the icu and intubation he did have some episodes of hypotension at this point his lisinopril was also held after the hypotension resolved he continued to be diuresed by the time the patient was discharged from the micu he had diurese a total of l during his admission on the medical hospital1 he was further diuresed down to a discharge weight of 250lb given the diastolic nature of his failure and no recent history of atrial fibrilation we decided to stop the patient s digoxin his diltiazem had also been discontinued at admission as he remained normotensive diltiazem and lisinopril may need to be restarted if he returns to hypertensive state particularly his lisinopril from which he would likely derive benefit both for chf and renal protection copd as stated above on admission it was also believed that some of the patient s dyspnea was associated with a copd exacerbation component he was ronchorous and tight with wheezing on his initial micu exam on admit he was placed on albuterol atrovent nebs steroids and antibiotics he was continued on the albuterol and atrovent throughout his course in the micu his steroids were tapered down and stopped prior to his transfer out of the micu on the floor he was continued on his albuterol atrovent nebs he was discharged to the rehabilitation facility with albuterol atrovent inhalers the patient notes however that he does not feel that these treatments work and does not plan to take them hyponatremia the patient also presented with hyponatremia his initial chemistry panel revealed a sodium of it was believed that this hyponatremia was secondary to fluid overload the patient s sodium levels began to normalize with diuresis his hyponatremia had resolved by the third day of admission and remained stable across the remainder of his admission hypotension after his readmission to the micu and intubation the patient had some problems with hypotension it was felt that this was most likely secondary to repeated sedation boluses he did require transient pressors for a short period of time to maintain his blood pressure furthermore the patient had some problems with bleeding from his oropharyngeal cavity after intubation in the setting of this bleeding the patient received blood on by the time the patient was discharged from the micu he was normotensive off pressors and with a low but stable hematocrit his antihypertensives other than lasix continued to be held in the setting of aggressive diuresis and low normal blood pressure but lisinopril in particular should likely be restarted once his blood pressure returns to higher levels oropharyngeal bleeding as mentioned above the patient had profuse bleeding during intubation this was felt to likely be oropharyngeal trauma in the setting a supratherapeutic ptt he also had dark maroon aspirated from his og tube as stated above the patient received blood on by the

a scab on his right face that he sometimes compulsively picked at despite expressing a wish not to and for some time needed constant bandage changes in the setting of heparin and coumadin this was resolving at time of discharge additionally he had a central line pulled and the scab at this site was stable he did not pick at it and there was no further bleeding he also has chronic bleeding from his lower extremity wound described below cytopenia the patient remained thrombocytopenic across his entire admission with platelet counts averaging approximately the cause of this was unclear at the time of discharge but it was noted that the patient had had a normal platelet count as recently as he also had a low white count and was anemic the most likely explanation for this is that he was nutritionally and metabolically challenged by his acute illness episode and that it will take some time to rebuild his cell lines this should be followed as an outpatient and if it does not resolve as he continues to recover from his acute illness episode he may warrant workup for hematologic problems anticoagulation because of his mechanical aortic valve the patient has a goal inr of to on

patient s chief complaint on admission was dyspnea it was felt that this dyspnea was consistent with a chf exacerbation although based on his lung exam with wheezing and rhonchi it was felt that there was also a copd component to the patient s dyspnea dfa for flu was negative urinary legionella antigen was also negative over the course of his initial icu stay he was treated with iv solumedrol nebs and cepodoxime azithromycin for copd flare he was also diuresed with lasix 120mg iv prn though he autodiuresed aggressively on his own he was transfered to the medical floor on the evening of around midnight of that day he was noted to have increased agitation he was then noted to become hypoxic and tachypneic he was evaluated by the floor team and noted to have diffuse crackles without significant wheezing he was given lasix but remained tachypneic low oxygen sats a cxr revealed bilateral opacification consistent pulmonary edema or new lul infiltrate additionally he was visibly oozing from his left face wound his nose and his lower extremity chronic venous stasis ulcers at this point he was transferred back to the micu upon arrival to the micu he appeared uncomfortable and tachypneic upon placement of bipap he became acutely more uncomfortable sitting forward pursed lip breathing the decision was made to intubate him he was treated as a flash pulmonary edema case he also completed a day course of vanco zosyn for possible hospital acquired pneumonia the patient remained intubated for days during which time he was diuresed with lasix eventually on he was able to be extubated in the days following his extubation he still appeared to be fluid overloaded therefore he continued to be diuresed aggressively over this time he reported that his dyspnea was improving on the patient was transferred from the unit to the medical floor on the floor he was continued to be diuresed and his respiratory status continued to improve by the time of admission his oxygen requirement had decreased to his baseline regimen of 2l nc we increased his home dose of lasix for discharge to the rehabilitation facility and recommended strict daily weights finally based on his anatomy and observing him at sleep in the morning he also may have a component of obstructive sleep apnea which may contribute to his pulmonary problems name ni outpatient workup for osa might be reasonable for this patient chf as stated above when the patient was admitted it was determined that some of his dyspnea was secondary to a chf exacerbation it was felt that he was fluid overloaded he was kept on his home lisinopril on admission and he was diuresed echo done on showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hyopokinesis and moderate mitral regurgitation diuresis continued through most of the patient s icu stay however after his readmission to the icu and intubation he did have some episodes of hypotension at this point his lisinopril was also held after the hypotension resolved he continued to be diuresed by the time the patient was discharged from the micu he had diurese a total of l during his admission on the medical hospital1 he was further diuresed down to a discharge weight of 250lb given the diastolic nature of his failure and no recent history of atrial fibrilation we decided to stop the patient s digoxin his diltiazem had also been discontinued at admission as he remained normotensive diltiazem and lisinopril may need to be restarted if he returns to hypertensive state particularly his lisinopril from which he would likely derive benefit both for chf and renal protection copd as stated above on admission it was also believed that some of the patient s dyspnea was associated with a copd exacerbation component he was ronchorous and tight with wheezing on his initial micu exam on admit he was placed on albuterol atrovent nebs steroids and antibiotics he was continued on the albuterol and atrovent throughout his course in the micu his steroids were tapered down and stopped prior to his transfer out of the micu on the floor he was continued on his albuterol atrovent nebs he was discharged to the rehabilitation facility with albuterol atrovent inhalers the patient notes however that he does not feel that these treatments work and does not plan to take them hyponatremia the patient also presented with hyponatremia his initial chemistry panel revealed a sodium of it was believed that this hyponatremia was secondary to fluid overload the patient s sodium levels began to normalize with diuresis his hyponatremia had resolved by the third day of admission and remained stable across the remainder of his admission hypotension after his readmission to the micu and intubation the patient had some problems with hypotension it was felt that this was most likely secondary to repeated sedation boluses he did require transient pressors for a short period of time to maintain his blood pressure furthermore the patient had some problems with bleeding from his oropharyngeal cavity after intubation in the setting of this bleeding the patient received blood on by the time the patient was discharged from the micu he was normotensive off pressors and with a low but stable hematocrit his antihypertensives other than lasix continued to be held in the setting of aggressive diuresis and low normal blood pressure but lisinopril in particular should likely be restarted once his blood pressure returns to higher levels oropharyngeal bleeding as mentioned above the patient had profuse bleeding during intubation this was felt to likely be oropharyngeal trauma in the setting a supratherapeutic ptt he also had dark maroon aspirated from his og tube as stated above the patient received blood on by the time of his discharge from the micu the patient had a low but stable hematocrit between and and without further signs of esophageal or oropharyngeal bleeding bleeding from wounds mr known lastname had a scab on his right face that he sometimes compulsively picked at despite expressing a wish not to and for some time needed constant bandage changes in the
