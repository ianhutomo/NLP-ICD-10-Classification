mg of adenosine without significant effect on systolic blood pressure was in the 70s heart rate was in the 170s the patient was shocked times two given bicarbonate calcium gluconate titrated up on levophed and started on digoxin the patient needed anti arrhythmic loading but limited by hepatic toxicity and blood pressures so therefore the patient was started on digoxin when liver function tests improved the patient was subsequently placed on amiodarone and was subsequently in sinus rhythm hypotension initially presumed to be cardiogenic but hemodynamics later were more consistent with sepsis and blood pressure and cardiac output improved with fluid boluses the patient was weaned off levophed but exquisitely sensitive to small changes in dose questionably thought to be secondary to autonomic dysfunction random cortisol was and improved to on corticotropin stim test the patient was treated with hydrocortisone times seven days given low random cortisol but not thought to be adrenally insufficient hypotension improved with volume the patient was able to be weaned from pressors blood pressure stabilized and the patient was able to be started on low dose ace inhibitor and beta blocker infectious disease persistent fevers septic physiology a chest x ray was without infiltrate urinalysis remained negative blood cultures were negative to date concern for sepsis given increased cardiac output and dropping svr the patient was continued on vancomycin levofloxacin and flagyl for broad coverage empirically times two weeks on the antibiotics which were renally dosed surveillance blood and fungal cultures were negative after a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics the patient started to produce sputum positive for e coli the patient was treated with a two week course of ceftaz cultured e coli was found to be fluoroquinolone resistant with the improvement in white blood cell count and downward trend in fever curve the pathogen was thought to be from a new ventilator acquired pneumonia versus prior infectious etiology for sepsis gastrointestinal evidence of shock liver with transaminases in the range and concerning for bowel ischemia given guaiac positive stools right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed without any gross abnormalities as perfusion formed liver function tests normalized and bowel function returned given the concern for guaiac positive stools the patient had an egd and colonoscopy egd showed a to centimeter mass in the esophagus and mild gastritis in the stomach body colonoscopy showed non bleeding rectal ulcer thought to be the cause of the guaiac positive stools hematocrit at the time of discharge was stable nutrition once bowel function returned the patient was started on tube feeds to assist her catabolic state once extubated speech and swallow evaluation ultimately cleared the patient for taking a regular diet at the time of discharge the patient was tolerating p o intake pulmonary evidence of congestive heart failure by chest x ray and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure oxygenation has not been an issue during this hospital course the patient was intubated prior to arrival and extubated on oxygenating and ventilating well she received a two week course of antibiotics with ceftazidine for e coli pneumonia renal acute renal failure atn from shock post atn diuresis the patient s creatinine improved at the time of discharge the renal function was stable thrombocytopenia first noted on hit antibody was negative however h2 blocker was stopped there was no evidence of dic the patient was restarted on subcutaneous heparin and platelets remained stable throughout the remainder of her hospital course neurologic the patient remained sedated for much of the hospital course and minimally responsive sedative medications versed and fentanyl were discontinued for hours without significance starting on at that point there was no significant improvement in mental status the thought was that the patient had taken large hit to liver and renal function secondary to sepsis shock since many of these medications are hepatically metabolized and renally cleared it was thought that the patient was not clearing these medications quickly the patient was started on dilantin with thoughts that there may have been seizure activity however this did not seem to make acute improvements in mental status towards the end of the hospital course the patient s mental status improved the patient was more awake and alert interactive at the time of discharge the patient demonstrated marked weakness secondary to immobilization however neurologically intact diabetes mellitus the patient was given a regular insulin sliding scale peripheral vascular disease the patient was status post right femoral popliteal bypass to continue aspirin and pletal fluids electrolytes and nutrition the patient s electrolytes were monitored and ultimately she was started on tube feeds at the time of discharge she was tolerating p o code status at the time of presentation the patient was full code and during hospital course the patient was changed to do not resuscitate at the time

recommended total of days of cefapime and to discontinue the linezolid as patient improved the plan was to give him a picc and to discharge him home on cefapime however patient refused picc his family

care had seen on prior admissions we initially held fentanyl patch given ams at admission fentanyl patch and morphine was restarted when his ms improved palliative care was consulted and they recommended increasing his po morphine dose and exploring the option of methadone at some future time we held off on changing his chronic pain management eg changing fentanyl to methadone but rather increased his prn morphine dosage to mg po q4h prn pain while here he tolerated mg of morphine sulfate po up to times a day without issue code status dnr dni i called the family and talked to them

pain management through palliative care recommendations hypocalcemia hypophosphatemia both ca and phos were low for several days requiring supplementation likely vit d def his pth was elevated because of low ca we started him on po vitamin d this is a new medication for him hypomagnesemia repleted withiv mgso4 as an outpatient we hope he can have his lytes checked q2 days for need of repletion as an outpatient pain from indwelling foley catheter was kinked on and nurses flushed it with resolution of pain notably we tried to upsize the foley however this was not able to be done rather our plan is for his caregivers at the nursing home to flush the foley with 100cc of sterile water or saline if urine output drops 30cc hr if this doesn t resolve the situation we would recommend changing the foley female first name un in urine not uncommon in frequently hospitilized patients typically only symptomatic patients though it is difficult to assess if he is symptomatic and pts with possible disseminated female first name un are treated we decided not to treat hypothyroidism continued home levothyroxine atrial fibrillation inr on admission and then his coumadin was held until his inr became therapeutic we trended his inr and it eventually trended down and his coumadin dose was increased to 5mg daily unfortunately it dropped below so we started heparin gtt now lovenox so that he

brief hospital course ms known lastname is an year old woman who was admitted for copd flare due to hypoxia and desaturation she likely has restrictive physiology with reactive airways disase during the course of her hospitalization she benefited most from sitting upright while eating being fed honey thickened liquids and receiving divalproex sodium sprinkles mg po tid that seemed to steady her mental status her course and treatment are as follows micu course the patient was admitted to the hospital unit name after transitioning from bipap to nc in the ed she arrived on nc satting well and breathing well but with evidence of hypoactive delerium she was started on prednisone azithromycin and home meds over her first night she became agitated and required haldol total 2mg in the am her mental status cleared and her respiratory status remained stable with neb stable on room air she was started on a steroid taper with a fast inital component then slowing once reaching what appears to be her critical dose of 15mg given her month of steroids she has been started on bactrim pcp name9 pre as well the patient was transferred to the floor stable on room air on the floor the patient had alternating episodes of lucency and unresponsiveness which per report from her extended care facility is a baseline mental status level hypoxia dyspnea ms known lastname has had two recent admissions for copd flare although this diagnosis is questionable given her lack of smoking history and other pulmonary disease she does have severe kyphosis that gives her a restrictive breathing physiology with a possible reactive component that appears to respond well to nebulizer steroid taper antibiotics and repositioning due to her alternating mental status she would probably not be able to tolerate perform pulmonary function tests therefore we will not be able to definitively rule out copd other causes of her hypoxia such as flash cardiopulmonary edema infection valvular disease and pulmonary embolism were considered however these causes were less likely the patient s oxygen saturation returned to her baseline saturations of the low to mid 90s on room air after initiating nubulizer steroid therapy and repositioning her to a more upright sitting position she was discharged from the hospital on a steroid taper as outlined in her discharge instructions however we are not certain that her pulmonary functioning is improving from this treatment we encourage standing nebulizer treatment and optimizing her positioning so as to improve her pulmonary function we also reccommend her to have all meals sitting up right and out of bed in order to prevent aspiration of note ms known lastname had an episode of suspected hypoxia one day prior to discharge however it was very difficult to get a pleth tracing initially based on a finger monitoring once pleth tracing achieved patient s o2 saturations were in the low 90s on room air her baseline no supplemental o2 was given during this episode given this event and her history of hypoxic episodes that are very short in nature these episodes could also be related to difficulty establishing o2 monitoring as well positioning problems recommend forehead monitoring of o2 sat levels if possible this tactic might prevent future hospitalizations altered mental status psychosis mrs hospital healthcare proxy her hospital was contact name ni during this admission as was her health care team at hospital1 each confirmed that during times of illness patient can decompensate and become paranoid and delusional per her hcp and long term nurse manager at hospital1 at baseline patient has moments of clarity but may relapse into unresponsiveness in a matter of minutes during this admission she was generally cooperative but was unresponsive on a couple of occasions she received depakote sprinkles with good effect and we reccommend that she be maintained on this medication hypertension we continued her home anti hypertensives with the exception of the nitroglycerin patch her blood pressure fluctuated during her course a more stable environment would offer better insight as to what her optimal medication regimen for this condition is chronic renal insufficiency patient has cri with baseline hct etiology unknown but presumably secondary to hypertension her medications were renally dosed and her urine output was monitored she is at baseline incontinent so monitoring her urine output was troublesome after removing her foley upon transfer from the micu her creatine slowly trended up and had a discharge level of medication causes of this trend are always possible but we did not change medications that could have caused this rise her po intake was relatively good but she could benefit from more po fluids recommend to re check creatine in a couple of days anemia her hematocrit ranged from the high 20s to the low 30s similar to her previous hospital courses her anemia appears to be related to her renal insufficiency she receives monthly procrit for this condition eye ectropion the patient has right eye lid ectropion on physical exam and she complains of right eye pain she would benefit seeing an opthamologist to evaluate this condition in the meantime she has been prescribed artificial tears to relieve some of the pain associated with this condition fen ms known lastname last name titles a low na diet and

the endocrinology consult and with patient s a m cortisol level of on the morning of prior to a dose of mg of prednisone it is most likely that patient is not adrenally insufficient given that she has a normal cortisol level it was recommended by the endocrinology team that patient continue on a prednisone taper of mg q day for the next day and then taper to mg q day afterwards starting on until patient can have a follow up appointment with the endocrinologist at the time of this dictation an endocrine appointment is still being scheduled depending on whether the patient would like to stay close to home or whether she can return to hospital1 for follow up patient will no longer need fludrocortisone so this was discontinued she will need initials namepattern4 last name namepattern4 stem test on her endocrine follow up appointment while she is a dose of prednisone mg a day in addition it is important that note that patient will require stress dose steroids in the event of an infection

consistent with chf patient was given nitro paste and lasix and then became hypotensive to the s dobutamine was started at outside hospital and patient received levofloxacin for a question of uti as well as vancomycin she was also given a dose of solu medrol for a question of adrenal insufficiency prior to solu medrol administration serum cortisol was checked at outside hospital and was low at

synephrine was started patient had only received a cc normal saline bolus prior to the start of pressors abdominal ct scan was performed which showed no bleed the patient was then at this point transferred to the hospital1 medical intensive care unit for further management on arrival to the micu patient was on dopamine and neo synephrine and her blood pressure was heart rate 120s and was saturating percent on nonrebreather over the course of her micu stay for one night patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated with liters of normal saline and her pressors were weaned to off she was

minute street address depressions in i and avl left axis deviation no q waves assessment this is an year old female with recent acute renal failure and a new diagnosis of bilateral adrenal masses who presents with fever and tachycardia and hypotension hospital course hypotension patient s hypotension was thought to be most likely due to early sepsis most probably from a urinary tract infection given her fever and positive urinalysis even though patient was diuresed at the outside hospital it is most likely that she was hypovolemic which would be explained by her tachycardia and hypotension since she did not receive adequate fluid resuscitation at the outside hospital the patient was aggressively fluid resuscitated in the medical intensive care unit with as much as liters of iv fluids and blood pressure stabilized in the systolics of 90s to low 100s patient s pressors were weaned to off in the medical intensive care unit as mentioned in the history of present illness and her o2 saturations remained stable at percent on liters nasal cannula upon transfer to the medicine floor patient s cultures remained negative from blood and urine patient is continued on levofloxacin and the vancomycin was discontinued since there was no obvious indication for continuing vancomycin given the patient s septic picture would recommend a day course total for levofloxacin patient will need five more days of levofloxacin to complete the day course patient s blood pressures upon discharge had been in the low 100s which most probably is the patient s baseline blood pressure and she has been hemodynamically stable there is question of whether her hypotension may have been secondary to adrenal insufficiency and this will be addressed below oxygen requirement the patient had an oxygen requirement through most of her hospitalization although upon discharge her o2 saturations have been percent on room air and percent on room air after ambulation it was thought initially that patient had mild chf which was consistent with chest x ray findings however patient did not show florid stigmata of heart failure on examination in addition the patient had a d echocardiogram performed on which revealed a normal systolic function and ef of greater than percent with no abnormalities except for mild plus mr name13 stitle did have ck s and troponins cycled which were negative for mi given her o2 requirement patient had a chest ct performed on which was performed without contrast and revealed small bilateral pleural effusions multiple calcified pleural plaques on the right and left pleural surfaces most probably consistent with prior asbestos exposure there is also a focal calcified granuloma within the right middle lobe but no other discrete pulmonary nodules and no intraparenchymal mass lesions she also had linear opacities right greater than left in the bases consistent with scarring the ct also had cuts of the adrenal glands which showed bilateral soft tissue densities in the adrenal glands right measuring x cm and the left measuring x cm with these chest ct findings as well as the ct findings at the outside hospital it is most likely that patient has had prior asbestos exposure and may have pleural plaques resulting from this after speaking to family the patient has apparently had a history of this granuloma in the past and even had a thoracotomy performed although further details are not available since the patient s o2 saturations have been stable on room air felt comfortable that her pulmonary status is stable bilateral adrenal masses and question of adrenal insufficiency the patient had an outside hospital biopsy performed which was concerning for carcinoma the final immunohistochemistry stains would not be back prior to discharge since they were sent out from the outside hospital there were no indications of metastasis on chest ct but the final diagnosis of what type of cancer patient may have is still not available at this time on admission patient s family notified the micu team that patient herself was not aware of the diagnosis of bilateral adrenal masses during her stay during the medicine hospital1 a family meeting was called to inform the patient about her bilateral adrenal masses and the possibility of carcinoma patient still does not seem to quite understand her diagnosis at this time but patient has a very good primary care followup with dr last name stitle dr name ni number is telephone fax patient also has an outpatient oncologist dr last name stitle who will follow up with the patient as an outpatient regarding the final immunohistochemistry stain and diagnosis and further treatment options as far as the question of adrenal insufficiency endocrine consult was called regarding patient s steroid taper they suggested tapering her steroids from hydrocortisone q to q hours and then dropping prednisone to mg on and then mg on upon discharge the patient should continue with this prednisone taper and should likely be tapered to mg on and mg on and should continue with mg of prednisone until her outpatient endocrine follow up appointment which will be made by her primary care physician last name namepattern4 last name stitle patient did have initials namepattern4 last name namepattern4 stim test checked on but this was in light of hydrocortisone levels and her cortisol levels were and then the endocrine consult had recommended initials namepattern4 last name namepattern4 stim test even in the light of hydrocortisone therapy on prior to patient s mg dose an a m cortisol and acth was checked and these results are still pending it was still unclear if the patient has a primary adrenal insufficiency at this time since she has conflicting data on prior to adrenal biopsy the patient did have an elevated potassium and low sodium levels but her random cortisol checked at that time was normal at the outside hospital at however patient did present with hypotension on but her k at that time at the outside hospital was normal going against primary adrenal insufficiency it is possible that her hypotension may all have been secondary to sepsis and it is difficult to interpret the low cortisol level of that was drawn at that time in the setting of an acute infection in addition patient has been on high dosed steroids now and the likelihood that she will become adrenally insufficient is probable the masses in the adrenal glands in films do not help indicate adrenal insufficiency since this may likely be metastasis as well from lymphomas or lung carcinoma thus at this time patient will continue as mentioned above with a prednisone taper of mg on mg on mg on and continue with those until outpatient endocrine followup she will continue with fludrocortisone mg p o q d times a total seven day course to end on an a m cortisol and acth are still pending from and this should be followed up with her primary care physician name10 nameis addition endocrine consult requested a hour urine collection for metanephrines bma and catecholamines to rule out pheochromocytoma however this was determined this could be done as an outpatient the pheochromocytoma was the most unlikely increased blood sugars the patient had high blood sugars at the start of her steroid therapy which have begun to decrease given her taper of steroids she has not required as much insulin at the time of discharge but she will still require q i d fingersticks given that she is still on a prednisone taper it was attempted to teach the patient diabetic teaching with insulin however patient has difficulty understanding how to administer the insulin she will need assistance with insulin teaching and diabetes management while she is on the prednisone taper hypothyroidism the patient had an elevated tsh at t4 of and t3 of endocrine consult did comment on these values and decided that the tsh was uninterpretable in the setting of acute infection patient should have a tsh repeated in weeks by her primary care physician acute renal failure patient s creatinine was elevated on admission to at the outside hospital although it had been as high as on upon discharge patient s creatinine is now and has been stable patient often requires additional fluids to supplement her p o intake and patient may have a component of prerenal in her acute renal failure a fena and urine electrolytes were checked and the fena was calculated to be percent which is not especially helpful in this setting it is likely that patient may have had some atn with her episodes of hypotension in the beginning of month only and then again on and patient s renal tubules may be recovering from this insult would recommend following patient s creatinine frequently as an outpatient and supplementing while patient is in a rehab facility with iv fluids liter every other day if patient appears dry on exam and is not taking sufficient p o the patient may likely have some element of chronic renal failure from the acute tubular necrosis but this maybe patient s new baseline creatinine disposition the patient will require either a skilled nursing facility or rehab facility for help with insulin teaching as well as medication administration physical therapy did work with the patient and felt that she was doing well from an ambulation and mobility standpoint discharge diagnoses
